This is a responsive website i made to mainly test my HTML,CSS & Javascript skills, it's pretty basic, but I wanted to make a quick website

It has cool hover effects and a pretty a nice clean design

You can view it at https://imregd.github.io/

If I am to work on this again I would definitely add more features to make it a little more enjoyable, maybe a nice web based game
